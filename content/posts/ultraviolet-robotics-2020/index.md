# The Beginning

Ultraviolet is a FIRST Tech Challenge community team based in Marietta, GA. We are a group of 4 Highschool students competing in a competitive robotics challenge with other teams in the area and around the state.

### Why Form a New Team?

Ultraviolet was formed out of a necessity of autonomy. All of our members came from a school team and we each saw that the "robotics" part of a team was constantly getting bogged down by all the bureaucracy of running a team, and having to work through a school. With our own team, we were able to work as much as we wanted, as late as we wanted, and move faster due to having less hoops to jump through.

## Kickoff

Kickoff happens in Mid-September, when the game is revealed to all the teams. The game changes each year to incorporate new elements, and present a different and fun challenge for teams to tackle. This season's game was "Ultimate Goal", a game consisting of picking up and shooting foam rings into elevated goals.

## Grand Plans

Going into the season, we had big ideas for what we wanted our robot to do, and how it was going to do it. We decided we wanted a tank drive due to it's simplicity and speed. One constraint we placed on ourselves was to keep the drivetrain ultra thin, only 46mm wide, to accommodate for as much space as possible in the center.

## Robot in 24 Hours

To prepare for the season, we hosted a "Robot in 24 Hours" challenge, where we tasked ourselves with building a competitive concept robot in only 24 hours (as the name suggests). We decided to make it harder on ourselves and keep to only a Kit of Parts, a curated kit of hardware and materials that typically serves as an absolute minimum to build a robot. This ended up being a very difficult process, however it was very educational, and got us familiar with the build system.

# Into the Season

## Drivetrain Troubles

Our 8 Wheel Drivetrain turned out to be incredibly stiff, having too much static friction to move. We alleviated this by making our pulleys wider, and dropping to 6 wheels to have less points of resistance. Another major issue we faced was accessing screws. In order to minimize time between iterations, the drivetrain plates were left "un-pocketed", where no holes were made unless where necessary. This made it incredibly difficult to attach things to the robot, as accessing screws was near impossible without removing a panel.

## Not a lot of time

As with most seasons, we ended up working until the last minute. Our drivetrain only started running weeks before the final competition date, and other designs were coming together untested until the night they needed to work perfectly.

## "What went wrong?"

We faced a lot of challenges this season, with some things avoidable and others inevitable. We could have been more proactive with our time, but that's something we'll have to improve for next season. A lot of challenges and positives we encountered this season were due to the size of our team. With only 4 members it makes it easier to communicate, however more responsibility lies on each person, therefore if one member was out for a week on vacation, all progress was stopped.

# Coming back better next year

Next year holds a lot in the cards for improvement. We currently have plans to incorporate as a non-profit organization to get greater autonomy and ability to take charitable donations. It will be senior year for all of us on the team, so that will present some challenges for time, but we hope to work through that.
