# The Beginning

Talk about who we are, members and stuff

### Why Form a New Team?

talk about why we wanted a new team and the grand plans

## Kickoff

planning and stuff in mid september, designs for drivetrains and shit

## Grand Plans

8wd, single belt, ultra thin, odometry, turret, flip out intake

## Robot in 24 Hours

Robot did decent, restricted ourselves to only KOP, many viewers

# Into the Season

## Drivetrain Troubles

too much friction, pulleys too thin, hard to access screws, takes time to make plates

## Not a lot of time

Working to the last minute, timeline of when dt was moving vs when comps were

### Portfolio too good too late

manage to make a good portfolio over the course of like 3 days. Wanted to have more drawings

## "What went wrong?"

build space, funding, time constraints, downsides of having a small team

# Coming back better next year

plans to incorporate, senior year troubles will be in full swing (hoping to be managed), final season for UV?
