# The Problem

I have a small car and I want to be able to carry a lot of things.

# Research

Other people have done the same thing with my car for themselves. We looked at some examples to get an idea of how we can fit a thing in the back and what it could look like

# Execution

The box is almost finished. It needs to be carpeted and then finally secured to the body of the car.
